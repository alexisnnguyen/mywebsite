                <h2>My Story</h2>
                <div class="upbringing">
                    <p>Growing up I always found myself fascinated by technology. My dad was a technician, and I knew I 
                        wanted to explore that world when he brought me to a Bring Your Child to Work Day where I got to 
                        learn about programming and development. The big challenge that I faced was that there weren't many 
                        women, let alone women of color, in the field. That discouraged me from pursuing engineering for many 
                        years, ultimately leading me to pursue nursing going into college.</p>
                    <p>Although I eventually made my way back into tech, I am thankful for all the skills I leanred from the 
                        medical field, especially as a nursing assistant where I developed many social and organizational 
                        skills. I learned to better interact with people of all identities and perform my duty as a team 
                        member. All these skill have been easily transferable to the different roles I have partaken in and 
                        in my daily life too.</p>
                    <p>Now as a CS student at University of Portland, I find myself immersed in innovation, either through my
                        classes, the communities and organizations I surround myself with, of even in the side projects I 
                        tackle during my free time. The past year, I have taught myself the basics of coding, in addition to 
                        the schooling I recieved, to get to where I am today. My interest and passion for tech has only grown 
                        since. My most recent interest, web development, has lead to to recreate my favorite games and even 
                        this website that you are currently on. My goal is to continue on this path and explore where 
                        technology may take our soceity and how I might play a role in that change.</p>
